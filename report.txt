My wordle had 06/04/2025 : {[C], [A], [D], [E], [E]}

but when I put it in the code, it gave me a word "that only has one E, even though orginal answer has 2 E's in it," Right word was "CEASE"
even though such word was included in word.json, it was ignored.

1. program failed to figure double Es WHEN 1 E WAS CONSIDERED CORRECT: 
        reason : since the word already has a correct E, it ignored the next E (didn't remove from usability)

THIS IS A BUG, FIX IT!!!!



[I tried to fix the bug but that issue no longer works???]
